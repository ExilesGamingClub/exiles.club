						<div class="content">
							<p>Welcome to Exiles Gaming Club! We are <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Exiles+Gaming+Club/@-33.907767,151.1627548,16.5z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x6b12b04e931eb893:0xd7fb6bdbd911995e!8m2!3d-33.9075522!4d151.1626455">located in Sydney's inner west in Marrickville</a>. Exiles is a not-for-profit run by a committee of club members.</p>
							<p>We are currently open on weekdays from 6pm to 11pm, and on weekends from 10am to 11pm.</p>
							<p>Join us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/ExilesGamingClub/">Facebook</a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/uTQGmuQ">Discord</a>!</p>

							<h3>Facilities</h3>
							<p>Exiles currently has multiple rooms available for use at various sizes. Some of these rooms are enclosed with a single table, while others are open and have multiple tables. We also have wargaming tables with terrain available for use.</p>

							<h3>Session times</h3>
							<p>Due to the current health concerns in Sydney, Exiles is currently operating as an appointment-only venue, rather than our usual drop-in venue. The following session times are available for booking:</p>
							<p>Weekdays (M-F): 1 session</p>
							<ul>
								<li>6pm - 11pm (18:00 - 23:00)</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Weekends: 3 sessions</p>
							<ul>
								<li>10am - 2pm (10:00 - 14:00)</li>
								<li>2:30pm - 6:30pm (14:30 - 18:30)</li>
								<li>7pm - 11pm (19:00 - 23:00)</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>Pricing</h3>
							<p>Our current pricing is $7 for members, and $10 for non-members. However we have a temporary $5 increase for all attendees to cover for our extra COVID precautions. This is a per-day payment, so if you are playing multiple games in a single day at Exiles, you only pay the entry fee once!</p>

							<h3>Cancellations/Refunds</h3>
							<p>If you need to cancel your event, email <a href="mailto:exiles.schedule@gmail.com">exiles.schedule@gmail.com</a> again, providing your Booking Reference ID, and a message saying that you need to cancel.
							<p>If the cancellation is at least 24 hours before your event, a refund will be provided.</p>
							<p>In special or extenuating circumstances, refunds may be allowed less than 24 hours to your event as well. Please outline the circumstance in your email, and the committee will get back to you regarding a refund in this case.
